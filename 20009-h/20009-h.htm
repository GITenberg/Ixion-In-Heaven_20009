     <i>&lsquo;IXION, King of Thessaly, famous for its horses, married
     Dia, daughter of Deioneus, who, in consequence of his son-
     in-law&rsquo;s non-fulfilment of his engagements, stole away some
     of the monarch&rsquo;s steeds. Ixion concealed his resentment
     under the mask of friendship. He invited his father-in-law
     to a feast at Larissa, the capital of his kingdom; and when
     Deioneus arrived according to his appointment, he threw him
     into a pit which he had previously filled with burning
     coals. This treachery so irritated the neighbouring princes,
     that all of them refused to perform the usual ceremony, by
     which a man was then purified of murder, and Ixion was
     shunned and despised by all mankind. Jupiter had compassion
     upon him, carried him to Heaven, and introduced him to the
     Father of the Gods. Such a favour, which ought to have
     awakened gratitude in Ixion, only served to inflame his bad
     passions; he became enamoured of Juno, and attempted to
     seduce her. Juno was willing to gratify the passion of
     Ixion, though, according to others,&rsquo; &amp;c.&mdash;Classical

     <i>An Errant King</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      THE thunder groaned, the wind howled, the rain fell in hissing torrents,
      impenetrable darkness covered the earth. A blue and forky flash darted a
      momentary light over the landscape. A Doric temple rose in the centre of a
      small and verdant plain, surrounded on all sides by green and hanging
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jove is my only friend,&rsquo; exclaimed a wanderer, as he muffled himself up
      in his mantle; &lsquo;and were it not for the porch of his temple, this night,
      methinks, would complete the work of my loving wife and my dutiful
      subjects.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The thunder died away, the wind sank into silence, the rain ceased, and
      the parting clouds exhibited the glittering crescent of the young moon. A
      sonorous and majestic voice sounded from the skies:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who art thou that hast no other friend than Jove?&rsquo; &lsquo;One whom all mankind
      unite in calling a wretch.&rsquo; &lsquo;Art thou a philosopher?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If philosophy be endurance. But for the rest, I was sometime a king, and
      am now a scatterling.&rsquo; &lsquo;How do they call thee? &lsquo;Ixion of Thessaly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ixion of Thessaly! I thought he was a happy man. I heard that he was just
      married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father of Gods and men! for I deem thee such, Thessaly is not Olympus.
      Conjugal felicity is only the portion of the immortals!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem! What! was Dia jealous, which is common; or false, which is commoner;
      or both, which is commonest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be neither. We quarrelled about nothing. Where there is little
      sympathy, or too much, the splitting of a straw is plot enough for a
      domestic tragedy. I was careless, her friends stigmatised me as callous;
      she cold, her friends styled her magnanimous. Public opinion was all on
      her side, merely because I did not choose that the world should interfere
      between me and my wife. Dia took the world&rsquo;s advice upon every point, and
      the world decided that she always acted rightly. However, life is life,
      either in a palace or a cave. I am glad you ordered it to leave off
      thundering.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A cool dog this. And Dia left thee? &lsquo;No; I left her.&rsquo; &lsquo;What, craven?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly. The truth is&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;tis a long story.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was over head and ears in debt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! that accounts for everything. Nothing so harassing as a want of
      money! But what lucky fellows you mortals are with your <i>post-obits!</i>
      We Immortals are deprived of this resource. I was obliged to get up a
      rebellion against my father, because he kept me so short, and could not
      die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You could have married for money. I did.&rsquo; &lsquo;I had no opportunity, there
      was so little female society in those days. When I came out, there were no
      heiresses except the Parcae, confirmed old maids; and no very rich
      dowager, except my grandmother, old Terra.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just the thing; the older the better. However, I married Dia, the
      daughter of Deioneus, with a prodigious portion; but after the ceremony
      the old gentleman would not fulfil his part of the contract without my
      giving up my stud. Can you conceive anything more unreasonable? I
      smothered my resentment at the time; for the truth is, my tradesmen all
      renewed my credit on the strength of the match, and so we went on very
      well for a year; but at last they began to smell a rat, and grew
      importunate. I entreated Dia to interfere; but she was a paragon of
      daughters, and always took the side of her father. If she had only been
      dutiful to her husband, she would have been a perfect woman. At last I
      invited Deioneus to the Larissa races, with the intention of conciliating
      him. The unprincipled old man bought the horse that I had backed, and by
      which I intended to have redeemed my fortunes, and withdrew it. My book
      was ruined. I dissembled my rage. I dug a pit in our garden, and filled it
      with burning coals. As my father-in-law and myself were taking a stroll
      after dinner, the worthy Deioneus fell in, merely by accident. Dia
      proclaimed me the murderer of her father, and, as a satisfaction to her
      wounded feelings, earnestly requested her subjects to decapitate her
      husband. She certainly was the best of daughters. There was no
      withstanding public opinion, an infuriated rabble, and a magnanimous wife
      at the same time. They surrounded my palace: I cut my way through the
      greasy-capped multitude, sword in hand, and gained a neighbouring Court,
      where I solicited my brother princes to purify me from the supposed
      murder. If I had only murdered a subject, they would have supported me
      against the people; but Deioneus being a crowned head, like themselves,
      they declared they would not countenance so immoral a being as his
      son-in-law. And so, at length, after much wandering, and shunned by all my
      species, I am here, Jove, in much higher society than I ever expected to
      mingle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, thou art a frank dog, and in a sufficiently severe scrape. The Gods
      must have pity on those for whom men have none. It is evident that Earth
      is too hot for thee at present, so I think thou hadst better come and stay
      a few weeks with us in Heaven.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take my thanks for hecatombs, great Jove.
      Thou art, indeed, a God!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hardly know whether our life will suit you. We dine at sunset; for
      Apollo is so much engaged that he cannot join us sooner, and no dinner
      goes off well without him. In the morning you are your own master, and
      must find amusement where you can. Diana will show you some tolerable
      sport. Do you shoot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No arrow surer. Fear not for me, Ã†giochus: I am always at home. But how
      am I to get to you?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will send Mercury; he is the best travelling
      companion in the world. What ho! my Eagle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The clouds joined, and darkness again fell over the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So! tread softly. Don&rsquo;t be nervous. Are you sick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little nausea; &lsquo;tis nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The novelty of the motion. The best thing is a beefsteak. We will stop at
      Taurus and take one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been a great traveller, Mercury?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! a wondrous spectacle. I long to travel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same thing over and over again. Little novelty and much change. I am
      wearied with exertion, and if I could get a pension would retire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet travel brings wisdom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It cures us of care. Seeing much we feel little, and learn how very petty
      are all those great affairs which cost us such anxiety.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel that already myself. Floating in this blue aether, what the devil
      is my wife to me, and her dirty Earth! My persecuting enemies seem so many
      pismires; and as for my debts, which have occasioned me so many brooding
      moments, honour and infamy, credit and beggary, seem to me alike
      ridiculous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mind is opening, Ixion. You will soon be a man of the world. To the
      left, and keep clear of that star.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who lives there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Fates know, not I. Some low people who are trying to shine into
      notice. &lsquo;Tis a parvenu planet, and only sprung into space within this
      century. We do not visit them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor devils! I feel hungry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. We shall get into Heaven by the first dinner bolt. You cannot
      arrive at a strange house at a better moment. We shall just have time to
      dress. I would not spoil my appetite by luncheon. Jupiter keeps a capital
      cook.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard of Nectar and Ambrosia.&rsquo; &lsquo;Poh! nobody touches them. They are
      regular old-fashioned celestial food, and merely put upon the side-table.
      Nothing goes down in Heaven now but infernal cookery. We took our chef
      from Proserpine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were you ever in Hell?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Several times. &lsquo;Tis the fashion now among the Olympians to pass the
      winter there.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is this the season in Heaven?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes; you are lucky.
      Olympus is quite full.&rsquo; &lsquo;It was kind of Jupiter to invite me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ay! he has
      his good points. And, no doubt, he has taken a liking to you, which is all
      very well. But be upon your guard. He has no heart, and is as capricious
      as he is tyrannical.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gods cannot be more unkind to me than men have been.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All those who have suffered think they have seen the worst. A great
      mistake. However, you are now in the high road to preferment, so we will
      not be dull. There are some good fellows enough amongst us. You will like
      old Neptune.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is he there now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he generally passes his summer with us. There is little stirring in
      the ocean at that season.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am anxious to see Mars.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! a brute, more a bully than a hero. Not at all in the best set. These
      mustachioed gentry are by no means the rage at present in Olympus. The
      women are all literary now, and Minerva has quite eclipsed Venus. Apollo
      is our hero. You must read his last work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hate reading.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do I. I have no time, and seldom do anything in that way but glance at
      a newspaper. Study and action will not combine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose I shall find the Goddesses very proud?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will find them as you find women below, of different dispositions
      with the same object. Venus is a flirt; Minerva a prude, who fancies she
      has a correct taste and a strong mind; and Juno a politician. As for the
      rest, faint heart never won fair lady; take a friendly hint, and do not be
      alarmed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear nothing. My mind mounts with my fortunes. We are above the clouds.
      They form beneath us a vast and snowy region, dim and irregular, as I have
      sometimes seen them clustering upon the horizon&rsquo;s ridge at sunset, like a
      raging sea stilled by some sudden supernatural frost and frozen into form!
      How bright the air above us, and how delicate its fragrant breath! I
      scarcely breathe, and yet my pulses beat like my first youth. I hardly
      feel my being. A splendour falls upon your presence. You seem, indeed, a
      God! Am I so glorious? This, this is Heaven!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The travellers landed on a vast flight of sparkling steps of lapis-lazuli.
      Ascending, they entered beautiful gardens; winding walks that yielded to
      the feet, and accelerated your passage by their rebounding pressure;
      fragrant shrubs covered with dazzling flowers, the fleeting tints of which
      changed every moment; groups of tall trees, with strange birds of
      brilliant and variegated plumage, singing and reposing in their sheeny
      foliage, and fountains of perfumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them rose an illimitable and golden palace, with high spreading
      domes of pearl, and long windows of crystal. Around the huge portal of
      ruby was ranged a company of winged genii, who smiled on Mercury as he
      passed them with his charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Father of Gods and men is dressing,&rsquo; said the son of Maia. &lsquo;I shall
      attend his toilet and inform him of your arrival. These are your rooms.
      Dinner will be ready in half an hour. I will call for you as I go down.
      You can be formally presented in the evening. At that time, inspired by
      liqueurs and his matchless band of wind instruments, you will agree with
      the world that Ã†giochus is the most finished God in existence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Ixion, are you ready?&rsquo; &lsquo;Even so. What says Jove?&rsquo; &lsquo;He smiled, but
      said nothing. He was trying on a new robe. By this time he is seated.
      Hark! the thunder. Come on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered a cupolaed hall. Seats of ivory and gold were ranged round a
      circular table of cedar, inlaid with the campaigns against the Titans, in
      silver exquisitely worked, a nuptial present of Vulcan. The service of
      gold plate threw all the ideas of the King of Thessaly as to royal
      magnificence into the darkest shade. The enormous plateau represented the
      constellations. Ixion viewed the Father of Gods and men with great
      interest, who, however, did not notice him. He acknowledged the majesty of
      that countenance whose nod shook Olympus. Majestically robust and
      luxuriantly lusty, his tapering waist was evidently immortal, for it
      defied Time, and his splendid auburn curls, parted on his forehead with
      celestial precision, descended over cheeks glowing with the purple
      radiancy of perpetual manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The haughty Juno was seated on his left hand and Ceres on his right. For
      the rest of the company there was Neptune, Latona, Minerva, and Apollo,
      and when Mercury and Ixion had taken their places, one seat was still
      vacant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is Diana?&rsquo; inquired Jupiter, with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My sister is hunting,&rsquo; said Apollo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is always too late for dinner,&rsquo; said Jupiter. &lsquo;No habit is less
      Goddess-like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Godlike pursuits cannot be expected to induce Goddess-like manners,&rsquo; said
      Juno, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt Diana will be here directly,&rsquo; said Latona, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jupiter seemed pacified, and at that instant the absent guest returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good sport, Di?&rsquo; inquired Neptune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very fair, uncle. Mamma,&rsquo; continued the sister of Apollo, addressing
      herself to Juno, whom she ever thus styled when she wished to conciliate
      her, &lsquo;I have brought you a new peacock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno was fond of pets, and was conciliated by the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bacchus made a great noise about this wine, Mercury,&rsquo; said Jupiter,&rsquo; but
      I think with little cause. What think you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It pleases me, but I am fatigued, and then all wine is agreeable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have had a long journey,&rsquo; replied the Thunderer. &lsquo;Ixion, I am glad to
      see you in Heaven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Majesty arrived to-day?&rsquo; inquired Minerva, to whom the King of
      Thessaly sat next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Within this hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must leave off talking of Time now,&rsquo; said Minerva, with a severe
      smile. &lsquo;Pray is there anything new in Greece?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not been at all in society lately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No new edition of Homer? I admire him exceedingly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All about Greece interests me,&rsquo; said Apollo, who, although handsome, was
      a somewhat melancholy lack-a-daisical looking personage, with his shirt
      collar thrown open, and his long curls theatrically arranged. &lsquo;All about
      Greece interests me. I always consider Greece my peculiar property. My
      best poems were written at Delphi. I travelled in Greece when I was young.
      I envy mankind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Ixion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes: they at least can look forward to a termination of the ennui of
      existence, but for us Celestials there is no prospect. Say what they like,
      immortality is a bore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You eat nothing, Apollo,&rsquo; said Ceres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor drink,&rsquo; said Neptune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To eat, to drink, what is it but to live; and what is life but death, if
      death be that which all men deem it, a thing insufferable, and to be
      shunned. I refresh myself now only with soda-water and biscuits. Ganymede,
      bring some.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although the <i>cuisine</i> of Olympus was considered perfect, the
      forlorn poet had unfortunately fixed upon the only two articles which were
      not comprised in its cellar or larder. In Heaven, there was neither
      soda-water nor biscuits. A great confusion consequently ensued; but at
      length the bard, whose love of fame was only equalled by his horror of
      getting fat, consoled himself with a swan stuffed with truffles, and a
      bottle of strong Tenedos wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of Homer?&rsquo; inquired Minerva of Apollo. &lsquo;Is he not
      delightful?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you think so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, I am desirous of your opinion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you should not have given me yours, for your taste is too fine for
      me to dare to differ with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have suspected, for some time, that you are rather a heretic&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the truth is,&rsquo; replied Apollo, playing with his rings, &lsquo;I do not
      think much of Homer. Homer was not esteemed in his own age, and our
      contemporaries are generally our best judges. The fact is, there are very
      few people who are qualified to decide upon matters of taste. A certain
      set, for certain reasons, resolve to cry up a certain writer, and the
      great mass soon join in. All is cant. And the present admiration of Homer
      is not less so. They say I have borrowed a great deal from him. The truth
      is, I never read Homer since I was a child, and I thought of him then what
      I think of him now, a writer of some wild irregular power, totally
      deficient in taste. Depend upon it, our contemporaries are our best
      judges, and his contemporaries decided that Homer was nothing. A great
      poet cannot be kept down. Look at my case. Marsyas said of my first volume
      that it was pretty good poetry for a God, and in answer I wrote a satire,
      and flayed Marsyas alive. But what is poetry, and what is criticism, and
      what is life? Air. And what is air? Do you know? I don&rsquo;t. All is mystery,
      and all is gloom, and ever and anon from out the clouds a star breaks
      forth, and glitters, and that star is Poetry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Splendid!&rsquo; exclaimed Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not exactly understand you,&rsquo; said Neptune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you heard from Proserpine, lately?&rsquo; inquired Jupiter of Ceres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yesterday,&rsquo; said the domestic mother. &lsquo;They talk of soon joining us. But
      Pluto is at present so busy, owing to the amazing quantity of wars going
      on now, that I am almost afraid he will scarcely be able to accompany
      her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno exchanged a telegraphic nod with Ceres. The Goddesses rose, and
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, old boy,&rsquo; said Jupiter to Ixion, instantly throwing off all his
      chivalric majesty, &lsquo;I drink your welcome in a magnum of Maraschino. Damn
      your poetry, Apollo, and, Mercury, give us one of your good stories.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! what do you think of him?&rsquo; asked Juno.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He appears to have a fine mind,&rsquo; said Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poh! he has very fine eyes,&rsquo; said Juno.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He seems a very nice, quiet young gentleman,&rsquo; said Ceres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt he is very amiable,&rsquo; said Latona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must have felt very strange,&rsquo; said Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hercules arrived with his bride Hebe; soon after the Graces dropped in,
      the most delightful personages in the world for a <i>soiree</i>, so useful
      and ready for anything. Afterwards came a few of the Muses, Thalia,
      Melpomene, and Terpsichore, famous for a charade or a proverb. Jupiter
      liked to be amused in the evening. Bacchus also came, but finding that the
      Gods had not yet left their wine, retired to pay them a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganymede announced coffee in the saloon of Juno. Jupiter was in superb
      good humour. He was amused by his mortal guest. He had condescended to
      tell one of his best stories in his best style, about Leda, not too
      scandalous, but gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those were bright days,&rsquo; said Neptune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can remember,&rsquo; said the Thunderer, with a twinkling eye. &lsquo;These youths
      have fallen upon duller times. There are no fine women now. Ixion, I drink
      to the health of your wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With all my heart, and may we never be nearer than we are at present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good! i&rsquo;faith; Apollo, your arm. Now for the ladies. La, la, la, la! la,
      la, la, la!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thunderer entered the saloon of Juno with that bow which no God could
      rival; all rose, and the King of Heaven seated himself between Ceres and
      Latona. The melancholy Apollo stood apart, and was soon carried off by
      Minerva to an assembly at the house of Mnemosyne. Mercury chatted with the
      Graces, and Bacchus with Diana. The three Muses favoured the company with
      singing, and the Queen of Heaven approached Ixion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does your Majesty dance?&rsquo; she haughtily inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On earth; I have few accomplishments even there, and none in Heaven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have led a strange life! I have heard of your adventures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A king who has lost his crown may generally gain at least experience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your courage is firm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have felt too much to care for much. Yesterday I was a vagabond exposed
      to every pitiless storm, and now I am the guest of Jove. While there is
      life there is hope, and he who laughs at Destiny will gain Fortune. I
      would go through the past again to enjoy the present, and feel that, after
      all, I am my wife&rsquo;s debtor, since, through her conduct, I can gaze upon
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No great spectacle. If that be all. I wish you better fortune.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I desire no greater.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are moderate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am perhaps more unreasonable than you imagine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met; the dark orbs of the Thessalian did not quail before the
      flashing vision of the Goddess. Juno grew pale. Juno turned away.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>&lsquo;Others say it was only a cloud.&rsquo;</i>

     <i>A Mortal Among the Gods.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      MERCURY and Ganymede were each lolling on an opposite couch in the
      antechamber of Olympus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is wonderful,&rsquo; said the son of Maia, yawning. &lsquo;It is incredible,&rsquo; 
      rejoined the cupbearer of Jove, stretching his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A miserable mortal!&rsquo; exclaimed the God, elevating his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A vile Thessalian!&rsquo; said the beautiful Phrygian, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not three days back an outcast among his own wretched species!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now commanding everybody in Heaven.&rsquo; &lsquo;He shall not command me,
      though,&rsquo; said Mercury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will he not?&rsquo; replied Ganymede. &lsquo;Why, what do you think? only last night;
      hark! here he comes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The companions jumped up from their couches; a light laugh was heard. The
      cedar portal was flung open, and Ixion lounged in, habited in a loose
      morning robe, and kicking before him one of his slippers. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; exclaimed
      the King of Thessaly, &lsquo;the very fellows I wanted to see! Ganymede, bring
      me some nectar; and, Mercury, run and tell Jove that I shall not dine at
      home to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger and the page exchanged looks of indignant consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! what are you waiting for?&rsquo; continued Ixion, looking round from the
      mirror in which he was arranging his locks. The messenger and the page
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So! this is Heaven,&rsquo; exclaimed the husband of Dia, flinging himself upon
      one of the couches; &lsquo;and a very pleasant place too. These worthy Immortals
      required their minds to be opened, and I trust I have effectually
      performed the necessary operation. They wanted to keep me down with their
      dull old-fashioned celestial airs, but I fancy I have given them change
      for their talent. To make your way in Heaven you must command. These
      exclusives sink under the audacious invention of an aspiring mind. Jove
      himself is really a fine old fellow, with some notions too. I am a prime
      favourite, and no one is greater authority with Ã†giochus on all subjects,
      from the character of the fair sex or the pedigree of a courser, down to
      the cut of a robe or the flavour of a dish. Thanks, Ganymede,&rsquo; continued
      the Thessalian, as he took the goblet from his returning attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I drink to your <i>bonnes fortunes</i>. Splendid! This nectar makes me
      feel quite immortal. By-the-bye, I hear sweet sounds. Who is in the Hall
      of Music?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Goddesses, royal sir, practise a new air of Euterpe, the words by
      Apollo. &lsquo;Tis pretty, and will doubtless be very popular, for it is all
      about moonlight and the misery of existence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I warrant it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a taste for poetry yourself?&rsquo; inquired Ganymede.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the least,&rsquo; replied Ixion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Apollo,&rsquo; continued the heavenly page, &lsquo;is a great genius, though Marsyas
      said that he never would be a poet because he was a God, and had no heart.
      But do you think, sir, that a poet does indeed need a heart?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really cannot say. I know my wife always said I had a bad heart and
      worse head; but what she meant, upon my honour I never could understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Minerva will ask you to write in her album.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will she indeed! I am sorry to hear it, for I can scarcely scrawl my
      signature. I should think that Jove himself cared little for all this
      nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jove loves an epigram. He does not esteem Apollo&rsquo;s works at all. Jove is
      of the classical school, and admires satire, provided there be no
      allusions to Gods and kings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course; I quite agree with him. I remember we had a confounded poet at
      Larissa who proved my family lived before the deluge, and asked me for a
      pension. I refused him, and then he wrote an epigram asserting that I
      sprang from the veritable stones thrown by Deucalion and Pyrrha at the
      re-peopling of the earth, and retained all the properties of my
      ancestors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha! Hark! there&rsquo;s a thunderbolt! I must run to Jove.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I will look in on the musicians. This way, I think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up the ruby staircase, turn to your right, down the amethyst gallery.
      Farewell!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye; a lively lad that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of Thessaly entered the Hall of Music with its golden walls and
      crystal dome. The Queen of Heaven was reclining in an easy chair, cutting
      out peacocks in small sheets of note paper. Minerva was making a pencil
      observation on a manuscript copy of the song: Apollo listened with
      deference to her laudatory criticisms. Another divine dame, standing by
      the side of Euterpe, who was seated by the harp, looked up as Ixion
      entered. The wild liquid glance of her soft but radiant countenance
      denoted the famed Goddess of Beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno just acknowledged the entrance of Ixion by a slight and haughty
      inclination of the head, and then resumed her employment. Minerva asked
      him his opinion of her amendment, of which he greatly approved. Apollo
      greeted him with a melancholy smile, and congratulated him on being
      mortal. Venus complimented him on his visit to Olympus, and expressed the
      pleasure that she experienced in making his acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of Heaven?&rsquo; inquired Venus, in a soft still voice, and
      with a smile like summer lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never found it so enchanting as at this moment,&rsquo; replied Ixion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little dull? For myself, I pass my time chiefly at Cnidos: you must
      come and visit me there. &lsquo;Tis the most charming place in the world. &lsquo;Tis
      said, you know, that our onions are like other people&rsquo;s roses. We will
      take care of you, if your wife come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No fear of that. She always remains at home and piques herself on her
      domestic virtues, which means pickling, and quarrelling with her husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I see you are a droll. Very good indeed. Well, for my part, I like a
      watering-place existence. Cnidos, Paphos, Cythera; you will usually find
      me at one of these places. I like the easy distraction of a career without
      any visible result. At these fascinating spots your gloomy race, to whom,
      by-the-bye, I am exceedingly partial, appear emancipated from the wearing
      fetters of their regular, dull, orderly, methodical, moral, political,
      toiling existence. I pride myself upon being the Goddess of
      watering-places. You really must pay me a visit at Cnidos.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such an invitation requires no repetition. And Cnidos is your favourite
      spot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it was so; but of late it has become so inundated with invalid
      Asiatics and valetudinarian Persians, that the simultaneous influx of the
      handsome heroes who swarm in from the islands to look after their
      daughters, scarcely compensates for the annoying presence of their yellow
      faces and shaking limbs. No, I think, on the whole, Paphos is my
      favourite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard of its magnificent luxury.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! &lsquo;tis lovely! Quite my idea of country life. Not a single tree! When
      Cyprus is very hot, you run to Paphos for a sea-breeze, and are sure to
      meet every one whose presence is in the least desirable. All the bores
      remain behind, as if by instinct.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember when we married, we talked of passing the honeymoon at
      Cythera, but Dia would have her waiting-maid and a bandbox stuffed between
      us in the chariot, so I got sulky after the first stage, and returned by
      myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were quite right. I hate bandboxes: they are always in the way. You
      would have liked Cythera if you had been in the least in love. High rocks
      and green knolls, bowery woods, winding walks, and delicious sunsets. I
      have not been there much of late,&rsquo; continued the Goddess, looking somewhat
      sad and serious, &lsquo;since&mdash;but I will not talk sentiment to Ixion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think, then, I am insensible?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you are right. We mortals grow callous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I have heard. How very odd!&rsquo; So saying, the Goddess glided away and
      saluted Mars, who at that moment entered the hall. Ixion was presented to
      the military hero, who looked fierce and bowed stiffly. The King of
      Thessaly turned upon his heel. Minerva opened her album, and invited him
      to inscribe a stanza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goddess of Wisdom,&rsquo; replied the King, &lsquo;unless you inspire me, the virgin
      page must remain pure as thyself. I can scarcely sign a decree.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it Ixion of Thessaly who says this; one who has seen so much, and, if
      I am not mistaken, has felt and thought so much? I can easily conceive why
      such a mind may desire to veil its movements from the common herd, but
      pray concede to Minerva the gratifying compliment of assuring her that she
      is the exception for whom this rule has been established.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I seem to listen to the inspired music of an oracle. Give me a pen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is one, plucked from a sacred owl.&rsquo; &lsquo;So! I write. There! Will it
      do?&rsquo; Minerva read the inscription:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>I HAVE SEEN THE WORLD, AND MORE THAN THE WORLD:
     I HAVE STUDIED THE HEART OF MAN,
     AND NOW I CONSORT WITH IMMORTALS.
     THE FRUIT OF MY TREE OF   KNOWLEDGE   IS   PLUCKED,
      AND  IT  IS  THIS,
     &lsquo;Adventures are to the Adventurous.&rsquo; 
     Written in the Album of Minerva, by
     Ixion in Heaven.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis brief,&rsquo; said the Goddess, with a musing air, &lsquo;but full of meaning.
      You have a daring soul and pregnant mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have dared much: what I may produce we have yet to see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must to Jove,&rsquo; said Minerva, &lsquo;to council. We shall meet again.
      Farewell, Ixion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Farewell, Glaucopis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of Thessaly stood away from the remaining guests, and leant with
      folded arms and pensive brow against a wreathed column. Mars listened to
      Venus with an air of deep devotion. Euterpe played an inspiring
      accompaniment to their conversation. The Queen of Heaven seemed engrossed
      in the creation of her paper peacocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ixion advanced and seated himself on a couch near Juno. His manner was
      divested of that reckless bearing and careless coolness by which it was in
      general distinguished. He was, perhaps, even a little embarrassed. His
      ready tongue deserted him. At length he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has your Majesty ever heard of the peacock of the Queen of Mesopotamia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Juno, with stately reserve; and then she added with an air
      of indifferent curiosity, &lsquo;Is it in any way remarkable?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Its breast is of silver, its wings of gold, its eyes of carbuncle, its
      claws of amethyst.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And its tail?&rsquo; eagerly inquired Juno.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is a secret,&rsquo; replied Ixion. &lsquo;The tail is the most wonderful part of
      all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! tell me, pray tell me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forget.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, no; it is impossible!&rsquo; exclaimed the animated Juno. &lsquo;Provoking
      mortal!&rsquo; continued the Goddess. &lsquo;Let me entreat you; tell me immediately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a reason which prevents me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can it be? How very odd! What reason can it possibly be? Now tell
      me; as a particular, a personal favour, I request you, do tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! The tail or the reason? The tail is wonderful, but the reason is
      much more so. I can only tell one. Now choose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What provoking things these human beings are! The tail is wonderful, but
      the reason is much more so. Well then, the reason; no, the tail. Stop,
      now, as a particular favour, pray tell me both. What can the tail be made
      of and what can the reason be? I am literally dying of curiosity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Majesty has cut out that peacock wrong,&rsquo; remarked Ixion. &lsquo;It is more
      like one of Minerva&rsquo;s owls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who cares about paper peacocks, when the Queen of Mesopotamia has got
      such a miracle!&rsquo; exclaimed Juno; and she tore the labours of the morning
      to pieces, and threw away the fragments with vexation. &lsquo;Now tell me
      instantly; if you have the slightest regard for me, tell me instantly.
      What was the tail made of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you do not wish to hear the reason?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That afterwards. Now! I am all ears.&rsquo; At this moment Ganymede entered,
      and whispered the Goddess, who rose in evident vexation, and retired to
      the presence of Jove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of Thessaly quitted the Hall of Music. Moody, yet not
      uninfluenced by a degree of wild excitement, he wandered forth into the
      gardens of Olympus. He came to a beautiful green retreat surrounded by
      enormous cedars, so vast that it seemed they must have been coeval with
      the creation; so fresh and brilliant, you would have deemed them wet with
      the dew of their first spring. The turf, softer than down, and exhaling,
      as you pressed it, an exquisite perfume, invited him to recline himself
      upon this natural couch. He threw himself upon the aromatic herbage, and
      leaning on his arm, fell into a deep reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours flew away; the sunshiny glades that opened in the distance had
      softened into shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ixion, how do you do?&rsquo; inquired a voice, wild, sweet, and thrilling as a
      bird. The King of Thessaly started and looked up with the distracted air
      of a man roused from a dream, or from complacent meditation over some
      strange, sweet secret. His cheek was flushed, his dark eyes flashed fire;
      his brow trembled, his dishevelled hair played in the fitful breeze. The
      King of Thessaly looked up, and beheld a most beautiful youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, he had attained about the age of puberty. His stature,
      however, was rather tall for his age, but exquisitely moulded and
      proportioned. Very fair, his somewhat round cheeks were tinted with a rich
      but delicate glow, like the rose of twilight, and lighted by dimples that
      twinkled like stars. His large and deep-blue eyes sparkled with
      exultation, and an air of ill-suppressed mockery quivered round his
      pouting lips. His light auburn hair, braided off his white forehead,
      clustered in massy curls on each side of his face, and fell in sunny
      torrents down his neck. And from the back of the beautiful youth there
      fluttered forth two wings, the tremulous plumage of which seemed to have
      been bathed in a sunset: so various, so radiant, and so novel were its
      shifting and wondrous tints; purple, and crimson, and gold; streaks of
      azure, dashes of orange and glossy black; now a single feather, whiter
      than light, and sparkling like the frost, stars of emerald and carbuncle,
      and then the prismatic blaze of an enormous brilliant! A quiver hung at
      the side of the beautiful youth, and he leant upon a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! God, for God thou must be!&rsquo; at length exclaimed Ixion. &lsquo;Do I behold
      the bright divinity of Love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am indeed Cupid,&rsquo; replied the youth; &lsquo;and am curious to know what Ixion
      is thinking about.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thought is often bolder than speech.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oracular,
      though a mortal! You need not be afraid to trust me. My aid I am sure you
      must need. Who ever was found in a reverie on the green turf, under the
      shade of spreading trees, without requiring the assistance of Cupid? Come!
      be frank, who is the heroine? Some love-sick nymph deserted on the far
      earth; or worse, some treacherous mistress, whose frailty is more easily
      forgotten than her charms? &lsquo;Tis a miserable situation, no doubt. It cannot
      be your wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Assuredly not,&rsquo; replied Ixion, with energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another man&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! an obdurate maiden?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ixion shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be a widow, then,&rsquo; continued Cupid. &lsquo;Who ever heard before of
      such a piece of work about a widow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have pity upon me, dread Cupid!&rsquo; exclaimed the King of Thessaly, rising
      suddenly from the ground, and falling on his knee before the God. &lsquo;Thou
      art the universal friend of man, and all nations alike throw their incense
      on thy altars. Thy divine discrimination has not deceived thee. I <i>am</i>
      in love; desperately, madly, fatally enamoured. The object of my passion
      is neither my own wife nor another man&rsquo;s. In spite of all they have said
      and sworn, I am a moral member of society. She is neither a maid nor a
      widow. She is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? what?&rsquo; exclaimed the impatient deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A Goddess!&rsquo; replied the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wheugh!&rsquo; whistled Cupid. &lsquo;What! has my mischievous mother been indulging
      you with an innocent flirtation?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; but it produced no effect upon me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a stout heart, then. Perhaps you have been reading poetry with
      Minerva, and are caught in one of her Platonic man-traps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She set one, but I broke away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a stout leg, then. But where are you, where are you? Is it Hebe?
      It can hardly be Diana, she is so cold. Is it a Muse, or is it one of the
      Graces?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ixion again shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, my dear fellow,&rsquo; said Cupid, quite in a confidential tone, &lsquo;you
      have told enough to make further reserve mere affectation. Ease your heart
      at once, and if I can assist you, depend upon my exertions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beneficent God!&rsquo; exclaimed Ixion, &lsquo;if I ever return to Larissa, the
      brightest temple in Greece shall hail thee for its inspiring deity. I
      address thee with all the confiding frankness of a devoted votary. Know,
      then, the heroine of my reverie was no less a personage than the Queen of
      Heaven herself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Juno! by all that is sacred!&rsquo; shouted Cupid. &lsquo;I am here,&rsquo; responded a
      voice of majestic melody. The stately form of the Queen of Heaven advanced
      from a neighbouring bower. Ixion stood with his eyes fixed upon the
      ground, with a throbbing heart and burning cheeks. Juno stood motionless,
      pale, and astounded. The God of Love burst into excessive laughter.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pretty pair!&rsquo; he exclaimed, fluttering between both, and laughing in
      their faces. &lsquo;Truly a pretty pair! Well! I see I am in your way.
      Good-bye!&rsquo; And so saying, the God pulled a couple of arrows from his
      quiver, and with the rapidity of lightning shot one in the respective
      breasts of the Queen of Heaven and the King of Thessaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amethystine twilight of Olympus died away. The stars blazed with tints
      of every hue. Ixion and Juno returned to the palace. She leant upon his
      arm; her eyes were fixed upon the ground; they were in sight of the
      gorgeous pile, and yet she had not spoken. Ixion, too, was silent, and
      gazed with abstraction upon the glowing sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, when within a hundred yards of the portal, Juno stopped, and
      looking up into the face of Ixion with an irresistible smile, she said, &lsquo;I
      am sure you cannot now refuse to tell me what the Queen of Mesopotamia&rsquo;s
      peacock&rsquo;s tail was made of!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is impossible now,&rsquo; said Ixion. &lsquo;Know, then, beautiful Goddess, that
      the tail of the Queen of Mesopotamia&rsquo;s peacock was made of some plumage
      she had stolen from the wings of Cupid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what was the reason that prevented you from telling me before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, beautiful Juno, I am the most discreet of men, and respect the
      secret of a lady, however trifling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to hear that,&rsquo; replied Juno, and they re-entered the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercury met Juno and Ixion in the gallery leading to the grand banqueting
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was looking for you,&rsquo; said the God, shaking his head. &lsquo;Jove is in a
      sublime rage. Dinner has been ready this hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of Thessaly and the Queen of Heaven exchanged a glance and
      entered the saloon. Jove looked up with a brow of thunder, but did not
      condescend to send forth a single flash of anger. Jove looked up and Jove
      looked down. All Olympus trembled as the Father of Gods and men resumed
      his soup. The rest of the guests seemed nervous and reserved, except
      Cupid, who said immediately to Juno, &lsquo;Your Majesty has been detained?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fell asleep in a bower reading Apollo&rsquo;s last poem,&rsquo; replied Juno. &lsquo;I am
      lucky, however, in finding a companion in my negligence. Ixion, where have
      you been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take a glass of nectar, Juno,&rsquo; said Cupid, with eyes twinkling with
      mischief; &lsquo;and perhaps Ixion will join us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the most solemn banquet ever celebrated in Olympus. Everyone
      seemed out of humour or out of spirits. Jupiter spoke only in
      monosyllables of suppressed rage, that sounded like distant thunder.
      Apollo whispered to Minerva. Mercury never opened his lips, but
      occasionally exchanged significant glances with Ganymede. Mars
      compensated, by his attentions to Venus, for his want of conversation.
      Cupid employed himself in asking disagreeable questions. At length the
      Goddesses retired. Mercury exerted himself to amuse Jove, but the
      Thunderer scarcely deigned to smile at his best stories. Mars picked his
      teeth, Apollo played with his rings, Ixion was buried in a profound
      reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great relief to all when Ganymede summoned them to the presence
      of their late companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have written a comment upon your inscription,&rsquo; said Minerva to Ixion,
      &lsquo;and am anxious for your opinion of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a wretched critic,&rsquo; said the King, breaking away from her. Juno
      smiled upon him in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ixion,&rsquo; said Venus, as he passed by, &lsquo;come and talk to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The bold Thessalian blushed, he stammered out an unmeaning excuse, he
      quitted the astonished but good-natured Goddess, and seated himself by
      Juno, and as he seated himself his moody brow seemed suddenly illumined
      with brilliant light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it so?&rsquo; said Venus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; said Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; said Cupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jupiter played piquette with Mercury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything goes wrong to-day,&rsquo; said the King of Heaven; &lsquo;cards wretched,
      and kept waiting for dinner, and by&mdash;&mdash;-a mortal!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Majesty must not be surprised,&rsquo; said the good-natured Mercury, with
      whom Ixion was no favourite. &lsquo;Your Majesty must not be very much surprised
      at the conduct of this creature. Considering what he is, and where he is,
      I am only astonished that his head is not more turned than it appears to
      be. A man, a thing made of mud, and in Heaven! Only think, sire! Is it not
      enough to inflame the brain of any child of clay? To be sure, keeping your
      Majesty from dinner is little short of celestial high treason. I hardly
      expected that, indeed. To order me about, to treat Ganymede as his own
      lacquey, and, in short, to command the whole household; all this might be
      expected from such a person in such a situation, but I confess I did think
      he had some little respect left for your Majesty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he does order you about, eh?&rsquo; inquired Jove. &lsquo;I have the spades.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! &lsquo;tis quite ludicrous,&rsquo; responded the son of Maia. &lsquo;Your Majesty would
      not expect from me the offices that this upstart daily requires.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eternal destiny! is&rsquo;t possible? That is my trick. And Ganymede, too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! quite shocking, I assure you, sire,&rsquo; said the beautiful cupbearer,
      leaning over the chair of Jove with all the easy insolence of a privileged
      favourite. &lsquo;Really, sire, if Ixion is to go on in the way he does, either
      he or I must quit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible?&rsquo; exclaimed Jupiter. &lsquo;But I can believe anything of a man
      who keeps me waiting for dinner. Two and three make five.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is Juno that encourages him so,&rsquo; said Ganymede.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does she encourage him?&rsquo; inquired Jove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everybody notices it,&rsquo; protested Ganymede.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is indeed a little noticed,&rsquo; observed Mercury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What business has such a fellow to speak to Juno?&rsquo; exclaimed Jove. &lsquo;A
      mere mortal, a mere miserable mortal! You have the point. How I have been
      deceived in this fellow! Who ever could have supposed that, after all my
      generosity to him, he would ever have kept me waiting for dinner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was walking with Juno,&rsquo; said Ganymede. &lsquo;It was all a sham about their
      having met by accident. Cupid saw them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Jupiter, turning pale; &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t say so! Repiqued, as I am a
      God. That is mine. Where is the Queen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talking to Ixion, sire,&rsquo; said Mercury. &lsquo;Oh, I beg your pardon, sire; I
      did not know you meant the queen of diamonds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind. I am repiqued, and I have been kept waiting for dinner.
      Accursed be this day! Is Ixion really talking to Juno? We will not endure
      this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is Juno?&rsquo; demanded Jupiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I cannot say,&rsquo; said Venus, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I do not know,&rsquo; said Minerva, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is Ixion?&rsquo; said Cupid, laughing outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mercury, Ganymede, find the Queen of Heaven instantly,&rsquo; thundered the
      Father of Gods and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The celestial messenger and the heavenly page flew away out of different
      doors. There was a terrible, an immortal silence. Sublime rage lowered on
      the brow of Jove like a storm upon the mountain-top. Minerva seated
      herself at the card-table and played at Patience. Venus and Cupid tittered
      in the background. Shortly returned the envoys, Mercury looking solemn,
      Ganymede malignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; inquired Jove; and all Olympus trembled at the monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercury shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her Majesty has been walking on the terrace with the King of Thessaly,&rsquo; 
      replied Ganymede.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is she now, sir?&rsquo; demanded Jupiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercury shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her Majesty is resting herself in the pavilion of Cupid, with the King of
      Thessaly,&rsquo; replied Ganymede.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confusion!&rsquo; exclaimed the Father of Gods and men; and he rose and seized
      a candle from the table, scattering the cards in all directions. Every one
      present, Minerva and Venus, and Mars and Apollo, and Mercury and Ganymede,
      and the Muses, and the Graces, and all the winged genii&mdash;each seized
      a candle; rifling the chandeliers, each followed Jove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way,&rsquo; said Mercury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way,&rsquo; said Ganymede.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way, this way!&rsquo; echoed the celestial crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mischief!&rsquo; cried Cupid; &lsquo;I must save my victims.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all upon the terrace. The Father of Gods and men, though both in
      a passion and a hurry, moved with dignity. It was, as customary in Heaven,
      a clear and starry night; but this eve Diana was indisposed, or otherwise
      engaged, and there was no moonlight. They were in sight of the pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you?&rsquo; inquired Cupid of one of the genii, who accidentally
      extinguished his candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a cloud,&rsquo; answered the winged genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A cloud! Just the thing. Now do me a shrewd turn, and Cupid is ever your
      debtor. Fly, fly, pretty cloud, and encompass yon pavilion with your form.
      Away! ask no questions; swift as my word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I declare there is a fog,&rsquo; said Venus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An evening mist in Heaven!&rsquo; said Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is Nox?&rsquo; said Jove. &lsquo;Everything goes wrong. Who ever heard of a
      mist in Heaven?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My candle is out,&rsquo; said Apollo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And mine, too,&rsquo; said Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And mine, and mine, and mine,&rsquo; said Mercury and Ganymede, and the Muses
      and the Graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the candles are out!&rsquo; said Cupid; &lsquo;a regular fog. I cannot even see
      the pavilion: it must be hereabouts, though,&rsquo; said the God to himself.
      &lsquo;So, so; I should be at home in my own pavilion, and am tolerably
      accustomed to stealing about in the dark. There is a step; and here,
      surely, is the lock. The door opens, but the cloud enters before me. Juno,
      Juno,&rsquo; whispered the God of Love, &lsquo;we are all here. Be contented to
      escape, like many other innocent dames, with your reputation only under a
      cloud: it will soon disperse; and lo! the heaven is clearing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must have been the heat of our flambeaux,&rsquo; said Venus; &lsquo;for see, the
      mist is vanished; here is the pavilion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganymede ran forward, and dashed open the door. Ixion was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seize him!&rsquo; said Jove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Juno is not here,&rsquo; said Mercury, with an air of blended congratulation
      and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Jove; &lsquo;seize him! He kept me waiting for dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this your hospitality, Ã†giochus?&rsquo; exclaimed Ixion, in a tone of
      bullying innocence. &lsquo;I shall defend myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seize him, seize him!&rsquo; exclaimed Jupiter. &lsquo;What! do you all falter? Are
      you afraid of a mortal?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a Thessalian?&rsquo; added Ganymede.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send for Hercules,&rsquo; said Jove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will fetch him in an instant,&rsquo; said Ganymede.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I protest,&rsquo; said the King of Thessaly, &lsquo;against this violation of the
      most sacred rights.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The marriage tie?&rsquo; said Mercury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The dinner-hour?&rsquo; said Jove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is no use talking sentiment to Ixion,&rsquo; said Venus; &lsquo;all mortals are
      callous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adventures are to the adventurous,&rsquo; said Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is Hercules! here is Hercules!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seize him!&rsquo; said Jove; &lsquo;seize that man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain the mortal struggled with the irresistible demigod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I fetch your thunderbolt, Jove?&rsquo; inquired Ganymede.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything short of eternal punishment is unworthy of a God,&rsquo; answered
      Jupiter, with great dignity. &lsquo;Apollo, bring me a wheel of your chariot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall I do to-morrow morning?&rsquo; inquired the God of Light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Order an eclipse,&rsquo; replied Jove. &lsquo;Bind the insolent wretch to the wheel;
      hurl him to Hades; its motion shall be perpetual.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What am I to bind him with?&rsquo; inquired Hercules.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The girdle of Venus,&rsquo; replied the Thunderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is all this?&rsquo; inquired Juno, advancing, pale and agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along; you shall see,&rsquo; answered Jupiter. &lsquo;Follow me, follow me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They all followed the leader, all the Gods, all the genii; in the midst,
      the brawny husband of Hebe bearing Ixion aloft, bound to the fatal wheel.
      They reached the terrace; they descended the sparkling steps of
      lapis-lazuli. Hercules held his burthen on high, ready, at a nod, to
      plunge the hapless but presumptuous mortal through space into Hades. The
      heavenly group surrounded him, and peeped over the starry abyss. It was a
      fine moral, and demonstrated the usual infelicity that attends unequal
      connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Celestial despot!&rsquo; said Ixion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment all sounds were hushed, as they listened to the last words of
      the unrivalled victim. Juno, in despair, leant upon the respective arms of
      Venus and Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Celestial despot!&rsquo; said Ixion, &lsquo;I defy the immortal ingenuity of thy
      cruelty. My memory must be as eternal as thy torture: that will support
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
